# InterviewBit-Programming ‚Äî Learning Algorithms

I solved over **500 problems** on InterviewBit. Here is the link to my [profile](https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/mariia-drozdova/). In this repository, I‚Äôm collecting the problems that I find especially useful to **review from time to time** ‚Äî either because they teach a deep concept, contain subtle edge cases, or are representative of common interview themes.
